# Kafka

```text
Kafka is an open-source stream processing platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It was originally created by LinkedIn and later open-sourced as an Apache project. Kafka is designed for handling real-time data feeds and is widely used for building scalable, high-throughput, and fault-tolerant data pipelines and event-driven architectures.

## Here are some key concepts and components of Kafka:

- `Producer`: Producers are responsible for publishing data or events to Kafka topics. They send messages to Kafka brokers, which are then made available to consumers.

- `Broker`: Kafka brokers are servers that store and manage the data streams. They receive messages from producers, store them on disk, and serve them to consumers. Kafka clusters typically consist of multiple brokers for scalability and fault tolerance.

- `Topic`: Topics in Kafka are named channels or categories to which messages are published by producers. Each message sent to Kafka belongs to a specific topic. Topics are used to categorize and organize the data.

- `Consumer`: Consumers read data from Kafka topics. They subscribe to one or more topics and process messages in real-time or at their own pace. Kafka allows multiple consumers to subscribe to the same topic, enabling parallel processing of data.

- `Partition`: Each Kafka topic is divided into partitions, which are the basic unit of parallelism and distribution. Partitions allow Kafka to horizontally scale data storage and processing. Each partition is ordered and immutable.

- `Offset`: An offset is a unique identifier assigned to each message within a partition. Consumers use offsets to keep track of the last message they have processed. This allows consumers to read messages from a specific point in the partition.

- `Zookeeper`: While Kafka used to rely on Apache ZooKeeper for distributed coordination and management of brokers in earlier versions, more recent versions of Kafka have reduced its dependence on ZooKeeper, and it is no longer a strict requirement for running Kafka clusters.

### Kafka is commonly used in various scenarios, including:

- Real-time event streaming and data pipelines.
- Log aggregation and data ingestion.
- Metrics and monitoring data collection.
- Building microservices and decoupling components through event-driven architectures.

Kafka's durability, scalability, and ability to handle high-throughput workloads have made it a popular choice in the world of data engineering and real-time data processing. It is widely used in industries like finance, e-commerce, social media, and more for handling large volumes of data and events.
